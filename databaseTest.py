import pymysql as h
import pymysql.cursors

"""
basics for this program
- used as an import for other files
- 'conn' is the connection used from pymysql

example conn
-------------------------------------------------
conn = h.connect(
    host = hostName,
    user = userName,
    password = password,
    db = database,
    charset = 'utf8mb4',

host = host name of the database
user = user for the database
password = the password for the database
db = database name
- each of these are counted as a string in python, so they should be declared as such
--------------------------------------------------
more clearer definition in the pymysql documentation online
